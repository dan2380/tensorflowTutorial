Python neural network tutorial
the topics that will be practiced:
AI - automation of a set of tasks that generally take some form of intellect to complete
Machine learning - rather than giving the program the rules, an algorithm figures out the rule for us
Neural Network: a form of machine learning that uses a layered representation of data
data will be passed through multiple layers to figure
features and lables
features are the input, information we are giving the model
lables are the output, what we are looking for

different kinds of machine learning
-unsupervised learning, supervised learning, and reinforced leearning

-supervised: features -> labels pass this information to a machine learning model and it will give us a set of rules

-unsupervised learning: only have features and no labels

-reinforcement learning: no data, agent, environment, and reward

will upload google colabs of the exercises done onto this github
